Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture which has made it an important destination for immigrants to Canada. Such a large population of immigrants from around the globe has also made Toronto one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.\nNeighborhoods in Toronto : Situated on the natural harbor, the city of Toronto is composed of five boroughs (each having multiple neighborhoods) which are now obsolete. They were amalgamated out of existence and replaced by the enlarged City of Toronto effective January 1, 1998. Borough names were Etobicoke, York, North York, East York and Scarborough, surrounding the old city of Toronto, which actually resembled an irregular inverted T.</p>"

You love your neighborhood, mainly because of all the great amenities and other types of venues that exist in the neighborhood, such as gourmet fast food joints, pharmacies, parks, grad schools and so on. Now, say you receive a job offer from a great company on the other side of the city with great career prospects. However, given the far distance from your current place you unfortunately must move if you decide to accept the offer. \nWouldn't it be great if you're able to determine neighborhoods on the other side of the city that are exactly the same as your current neighborhood, and if not perhaps similar neighborhoods that are at least closer to your new job?</p>"
